## How it works

The Pomodoro® Technique is an extremely simple but efficient time management
technique developed by Francesco Cirillo.

The basic idea is it's simpler to concentrate on work for a relatively short
period, keeping in mind you can take a rest or switch to another activity
afterwards.

- Split your work for 25 minute intervals, separated by short break periods.
- In these 25 minute intervals try to focus on your work as much as possible,
  try to not distract yourself and to avoid other distractions.
- After a 25 minute interval take a 5 minute break. During this break do any
  other activities except for the previous work.
- Return to the work after the break.
- Take a long break of about 10–30 minutes after every 4 work intervals.

### Counters

There are two counters at the bottom of the main page. They can be used to count
anything. For example, you can count external interruptions with the left
counter, while counting internal interruptions (you interrupting yourself) with
the right counter.ifdef(${__X_readme}, ${ See also
